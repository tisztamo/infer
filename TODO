- Batch normalization
- Position value estimation using the combination of predefined features and CNN in order to get hints of the source of the value in human-understandable terms. (How much a Bishop-pair is worth in this situation?)
- Network optimization for better results, faster training and inference
- Learn to classify positions that a player "likes" - e.g. positions from his winning games vs the same positions flipped (what his opponent sees)
- Remove draws (and captures?) from evaluation training and use a 2-output classifier
- Implement the DeepChess evaluation (and search)
