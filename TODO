- Scope tf variables
- More visualization
- Fix batch normalization
- Position value estimation using the combination of predefined features and CNN in order to get hints of the source of the value in human-understandable terms. (How much a Bishop-pair is worth in this situation?)
- Network optimization/compression for better results, faster training and inference
- Learn to classify positions that a player "likes" - e.g. positions from his winning games vs the same positions flipped (what his opponent sees)
- Implement the DeepChess evaluation (and search)
