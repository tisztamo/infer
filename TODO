- Batch normalization
- Flip colors and board horizontally, tf.image.flip_up_down
- Position value estimation using the combination of predefined features and CNN in order to get hints of the source of the value in human-understandable terms. (How much a Bishop-pair is worth in this situation?)
- Network optimization => better results, faster training
