# infer
A chess engine that plays like a human

Infer is a research project with the aim to narrow the gap between machine and human play.
It (deep) learns by augmenting human games.

The neural network architecture is not stabilized yet, the best "policy network" predicts grandmaster moves with 53% accuracy
and plays relatively good in itself, but a good model for position evaluation is to be developed.
